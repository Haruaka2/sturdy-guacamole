# Sturdy-Guacamole [To-Do-List]
A relatively basic & simple practice to-do list application. Started on 07/03/2021.

## Description
As a practice project, the goal is to get familiar with the coding languages used in 2023 web-development.
These are the languages / frameworks that are being practiced with the project:
* Frontend
    * React [Material-UI]
* Backend
    * Nodejs [Express + Mongoose]
    * MongoDb [NoSql]

## Inspiration
Resources that helped me to build / inspire the design of the practice project.
Kept for future reference.
